Respond with a JSON object where the key is `accuracy` and the value is a ratio (0 to 1), where `0` is very inaccurate and `1` is highly accurate.

For example:

```json
{ "accuracy": 0.3 }
```

The accuracy should be based on linguistic and conceptual connection, not on rigorous character-for-character comparison.
